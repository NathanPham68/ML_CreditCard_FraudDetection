This project focuses on building a basic Machine Learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. We use a structured dataset containing real-world transaction details, including customer demographics, transaction metadata, and merchant information.

The key objective is to classify whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0) using various features in the dataset.
